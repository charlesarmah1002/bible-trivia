# The Bible Character Trivia

I have always wanted to find a way to challenge people to learn more about the Bible and how much fun it can be, but ðŸ˜¿. It's been a very hard journey.

Went across space ðŸš€ and time âŒ›, then it hit me. I know a lot of Bible characters. Why don't I challenge everyone to a battle royale to see how good everyone is at.

This is version 0.2.8.

If you don't get it, don't worry about it, cause I do and don't get it too ðŸ¤”.

The official version will be out once I am able to come up with proper documentation and satisfy some more project requirements.
